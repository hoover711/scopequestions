Global and local scopes are the two different types of scope that we encounter in JavaScript. Any variable that can be retrieved and altered anywhere in your code is global. Any variable declared outside of a function in JavaScript has variable scope. 
Global variables are avoided because they can easily be overwritten by other scripts. They are also prone to unintended side effects. Global variables with unintended side effects can almost guarantee that your code will be indeterminate. 
When strict mode in JavaScript is enabled, any time a variable is declared with the let or const keyword an error will be triggered. The ‘use strict’ command can be put at the top of the file to enforce or at the top of a function. It is also a good practice to pu ‘use let’ at the top of all JS files. 
Side effects are when a function reaches outside its local scope up into a parent scope and alters into a value that lives there. Sometimes they can be a good thing, but more than not, when side effects are unintended you have code that inadvertently changes the outside world in order to carry out instructions. This can lead to a function being indeterminate- meaning it returns one value sometimes and another value other times. For a function to be pure, it must be determinate, meaning it always returns the same value if its provided with the same inputs, and also be free of side effects.
